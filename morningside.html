                <p> Trying to take a nap, but would like to get face-time while doing so? Library West is located on University Ave and north of the Plaza of Americas. Here you can take a break from the grind and nap in one of the many cushioned chairs for all your facey friends to see! With 4 floors to choose from you can't go wrong.  </p>
