         <p>   GatorTrails is dedicated to finding and providing students and residents in Gainesville an easy an manageable way to find running trails around campus.

GatorTrails.com is Gainesville's internet home for runners. What we hope to accomplish is to have Gainesville residents regularly look up our trails and go out and run 'em!
             We don’t try and re-invent the wheel at GatorTrails. We scour campus and the community looking for all those great traits in a good trail - mileage, shade, terrain,  amenities, you name it. There’s a reason students throughout Gainesville come to GatorTrails to find out where there next run is going to be. </p>
